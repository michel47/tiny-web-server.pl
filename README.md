# A tiny web server 

It uses stream sockets and is written in Perl.

It supports
 - GET and POST methods (handling parameters passed via either method).
 - the sending of cookies
 - the execution of server-side scripts (scripts have the ".cgi" extension only and everything else is just a page)

The `site` folder is a website to test on.
